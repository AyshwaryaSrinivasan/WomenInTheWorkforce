# Women In The Workforce

![Workforce](/images/workforce.jpg)

Gender bias in earnings is an ongoing issue. In 2019, the [American Association of University Women (AAUW)](https://www.aauw.org/research/the-simple-truth-about-the-gender-pay-gap/) stated that women who work full-time earn about 80 percent of what their male counterparts make. This project aims to highlight the wage gap issues.

We first perform Data Cleaning and then perform Exploratory Data Analysis. Our Analysis is split into 3 parts. 

* Industry based analysis
* Gender based Analysis
* Time series analysis

**There are multiple datasets used for the analysis**

1. earnings_female.csv
2. employed_gender.csv	
3. jobs_gender.csv	

**Execution**

The files must be executed in the following order:

1. Women in the Workforce.Rmd
