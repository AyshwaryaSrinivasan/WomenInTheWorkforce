# Women In The Workforce



Gender bias in earnings is an ongoing issue. In 2019, the [American Association of University Women (AAUW)](https://www.aauw.org/research/the-simple-truth-about-the-gender-pay-gap/) stated that women who work full-time earn about 80 percent of what their male counterparts make. This report identified the following problems which we attempt to investigate in our study:

* The gender wage gap continues to grow over time.
* Women of all age groups face gender pay gap.
* Women face a wider pay gap as they get older.
* Women are still faced with the gender pay gap in occupations with an equal representation of male and female workers.
